2)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

  HTTP/1.1 was developed by Timpthy-Berners Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for world wide web.
  It is a top level application protocol that exhanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.
  A client sends a text based request to server using methods like Get and Post methids.The server sends an HTML page in response.
  Client sends the request using get method,in response the server returns a html page.
  
  HTTP/2 was developed primarly by Google with the intension of web page load by using as compression,multiplexing,and prioritization.
  From the beginning,many browsers supported this standardization effort,including Chrome,Opera,Internet Explorer,and Safar
  
  HTTP/1.1 keeps all requests and responses in plain text format where as HTTP/2 uses binary framing layer to encapsulate all the messages.
  
3)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Object-It is an Instance of a Class.
A javascript object is an entity having properties and methods.
Javascript is object based language,everything is an object in Javascript.
We can create objects in javascript in 3 ways
By using Object Literal
Syntax:
employee={id:102,name:"Shyam Kumar",salary:40000}  
console.log(employee.id+" "+employee.name+" "+employee.salary);  
By Creating an Instance
Syntax:
    let Objectname=new Classname("properties");
    var emp=new Object();  
    emp.id=101;  
    emp.name="Ravi Malik";  
    emp.salary=50000;  
    console.log(emp.id+" "+emp.name+" "+emp.salary);  
By using an Object Constructor
we use this keyword here which refers to the current object
function emp(id,name,salary){  
this.id=id;  
this.name=name;  
this.salary=salary;  
}  
e=new emp(103,"Vimal Jaiswal",30000);
console.log(e.id+" "+e.name+" "+e.salary);  

We can define method in JavaScript object.But before defining method,we need to add property in the function with same name as method.
